# Project Insights — Student Score Analyzer

### Overview
This mini project was part of my **Q1 (Aug–Oct 2025)** roadmap to master Python, NumPy, and Pandas.  
The goal was to apply everything I learned in the Data Science foundation phase to a real, logical dataset.

### Key Learnings
- Data Cleaning: handling missing/non-numeric values using Pandas
- Aggregations: using `.mean()`, `.max()`, and conditional logic
- Column Operations: slicing with `df.columns[]`, filtering with conditions
- Exporting Results: writing processed data using `.to_csv()`
- Thinking Like an Analyst: finding patterns, top scorers, and data-driven insights

### Technical Stack
- Python 3.13.5
- NumPy
- Pandas

### Next Steps
- Rewatch Matplotlib module
- Build Mini Project #2
- Continue Proof-of-Work documentation on GitHub
